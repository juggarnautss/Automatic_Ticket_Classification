I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018.

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.

demand reserve for specify cash balance in my xxxx account in reserve for a provision in my xxxx divorce decree that have previously be satisfied with my ex - wife ; demand further cash reserve beyond   mos balance which be hold in chase account by require account at other bank ;

i.e. , cash out or owelty rate & term refinance but not combine ;   ) chase order an appraisal which be available to use by another lender who actually understand how to process and owelty refinance and refuse to allow for the appraisal to be release and thereby cause duplicate expense and further delay ;   ) chase have claim that new requirement for conventional loan have be publish as a result of covid- and now require I to assert that I be self - employ - which I believe chase be do so that the rate chase lock for this loan and the type of product can be change to cover up their series of error and charge more for the loan . \\n\\n lastly , chase have collect all of the documentation request and have edit the entry on the application and demand that I sign these modify form . I notice several error and omission on their part in how they record the datum they demand and to which I provide document , yet they have not correct those same form . \\n\\n I believe chase be act in bad faith and be fabricate unreasonable demand to delay progress on the application because they know they can not proceed as a split cash - out / owelty rate & term loan as they have construct . the chase management have give excuse that they can not release the appraisal because they could be help liable ; state that the covid- rule require xxxx attestation and will not confirm that chase will refund the { $ . } I pay at application .\",\n          \"in xx / xx/ I open a xxxx auto loan with chase bank . today , I try to make my payment via the telephone and be unsure of whether it have go through or not .

I again key in { $ . } and request large bill and again I receive xxxx ' s. i they proceed to key in { $ . } to which I receive a receipt which indicate that my transaction be deny . \\n I then check my account and realize I be debit twice for { $ . } , once for { $ . } and also credit for { $ . } . ( the { $ . } transaction be subsequently wash ) . I make a call to chase bank about the atm transaction and to report and file a claim , I be tell by the representative that I will be credit { $ . } in xxxx hrs .

I go to visit the branch to see if there be anything that can be do for I , I be tell that just what I do be exactly the same procedure they must follow , as the branch do not service the atm , it be do by their back office personnel . on xxxx xxxx the amount of { $ . } previously credit to my account be reverse . I make a call on xxxx xxxx in regard to the reversal and be tell that my claim have be close however it will be reopen this time as per my request in order that their personnel can investigate , the investigation will take - day . I make a call xxxx xxxx to inquire as to the status of my claim and be tell my claim have be close there be nothing more that chase bank can do for I . please note that I have be a customer of this bank for   year and never encounter a problem such as this . now that I have I be treat with scant respect .

demand reserve for specify cash balance in my xxxx account in reserve for a provision in my xxxx divorce decree that have previously be satisfied with my ex - wife ; demand further cash reserve beyond   mos balance which be hold in chase account by require account at other bank ;

i.e. , cash out or owelty rate & term refinance but not combine ;   ) chase order an appraisal which be available to use by another lender who actually understand how to process and owelty refinance and refuse to allow for the appraisal to be release and thereby cause duplicate expense and further delay ;   ) chase have claim that new requirement for conventional loan have be publish as a result of covid- and now require I to assert that I be self - employ - which I believe chase be do so that the rate chase lock for this loan and the type of product can be change to cover up their series of error and charge more for the loan . \\n\\n lastly , chase have collect all of the documentation request and have edit the entry on the application and demand that I sign these modify form . I notice several error and omission on their part in how they record the datum they demand and to which I provide document , yet they have not correct those same form . \\n\\n I believe chase be act in bad faith and be fabricate unreasonable demand to delay progress on the application because they know they can not proceed as a split cash - out / owelty rate & term loan as they have construct . the chase management have give excuse that they can not release the appraisal because they could be help liable ; state that the covid- rule require xxxx attestation and will not confirm that chase will refund the { $ . } I pay at application .\",\n          \"in xx / xx/ I open a xxxx auto loan with chase bank . today , I try to make my payment via the telephone and be unsure of whether it have go through or not .

demand reserve for specify cash balance in my xxxx account in reserve for a provision in my xxxx divorce decree that have previously be satisfied with my ex - wife ; demand further cash reserve beyond   mos balance which be hold in chase account by require account at other bank ;

i.e. , cash out or owelty rate & term refinance but not combine ;   ) chase order an appraisal which be available to use by another lender who actually understand how to process and owelty refinance and refuse to allow for the appraisal to be release and thereby cause duplicate expense and further delay ;   ) chase have claim that new requirement for conventional loan have be publish as a result of covid- and now require I to assert that I be self - employ - which I believe chase be do so that the rate chase lock for this loan and the type of product can be change to cover up their series of error and charge more for the loan . \\n\\n lastly , chase have collect all of the documentation request and have edit the entry on the application and demand that I sign these modify form . I notice several error and omission on their part in how they record the datum they demand and to which I provide document , yet they have not correct those same form . \\n\\n I believe chase be act in bad faith and be fabricate unreasonable demand to delay progress on the application because they know they can not proceed as a split cash - out / owelty rate & term loan as they have construct . the chase management have give excuse that they can not release the appraisal because they could be help liable ; state that the covid- rule require xxxx attestation and will not confirm that chase will refund the { $ . } I pay at application .\",\n          \"in xx / xx/ I open a xxxx auto loan with chase bank . today , I try to make my payment via the telephone and be unsure of whether it have go through or not .

demand reserve for specify cash balance in my xxxx account in reserve for a provision in my xxxx divorce decree that have previously be satisfied with my ex - wife ; demand further cash reserve beyond   mos balance which be hold in chase account by require account at other bank ;

i.e. , cash out or owelty rate & term refinance but not combine ;   ) chase order an appraisal which be available to use by another lender who actually understand how to process and owelty refinance and refuse to allow for the appraisal to be release and thereby cause duplicate expense and further delay ;   ) chase have claim that new requirement for conventional loan have be publish as a result of covid- and now require I to assert that I be self - employ - which I believe chase be do so that the rate chase lock for this loan and the type of product can be change to cover up their series of error and charge more for the loan . \\n\\n lastly , chase have collect all of the documentation request and have edit the entry on the application and demand that I sign these modify form . I notice several error and omission on their part in how they record the datum they demand and to which I provide document , yet they have not correct those same form . \\n\\n I believe chase be act in bad faith and be fabricate unreasonable demand to delay progress on the application because they know they can not proceed as a split cash - out / owelty rate & term loan as they have construct . the chase management have give excuse that they can not release the appraisal because they could be help liable ; state that the covid- rule require xxxx attestation and will not confirm that chase will refund the { $ . } I pay at application .\",\n          \"in xx / xx/ I open a xxxx auto loan with chase bank . today , I try to make my payment via the telephone and be unsure of whether it have go through or not .

( the { $ . } transaction be subsequently wash ) . I make a call to chase bank about the atm transaction and to report and file a claim , I be tell by the representative that I will be credit { $ . } in xxxx hrs .

I go to visit the branch to see if there be anything that can be do for I , I be tell that just what I do be exactly the same procedure they must follow , as the branch do not service the atm , it be do by their back office personnel . on xxxx xxxx the amount of { $ . } previously credit to my account be reverse .

I notice several error and omission on their part in how they record the datum they demand and to which I provide document , yet they have not correct those same form . \\n\\n I believe chase be act in bad faith and be fabricate unreasonable demand to delay progress on the application because they know they can not proceed as a split cash - out / owelty rate & term loan as they have construct . the chase management have give excuse that they can not release the appraisal because they could be help liable ; state that the covid- rule require xxxx attestation and will not confirm that chase will refund the { $ . } I pay at application .\",\n          \"in xx / xx/ I open a xxxx auto loan with chase bank . today , I try to make my payment via the telephone and be unsure of whether it have go through or not . I call in to make my inquiry , and I speak to , and be transfer to / from ,   people . each of these people would not speak to I until I give they my ssn , make , model , year , dob , and address . just to get the understanding that my auto loan payment I make via the telephone be proper , I have to decide this information   time . yup ,   time . the chase system be too arduous and too difficult to manage if even I can not access information . of course , their representative be horrible and difficult . I far do not wish to give out my private information to call center representative , as that practice be incredibly unsafe in its own right .\",\n          \"on xxxx xxxx , I visit chase bank to make a withdrawal of { $ . } from my checking account , when I get into the bank , the atm machine I use be read out of service . I be elated when it become available for use as I be at the top of the line and the first customer to use it . I key in { $ . } and request large bill , I receive xxxx ' s. I again key in { $ . } and request large bill and again I receive xxxx ' s. i they proceed to key in { $ . } to which I receive a receipt which indicate that my transaction be deny . \\n I then check my account and realize I be debit twice for { $ . } , once for { $ . } and also credit for { $ . } . ( the { $ . } transaction be subsequently wash ) . I make a call to chase bank about the atm transaction and to report and file a claim , I be tell by the representative that I will be credit { $ . } in xxxx hrs . I make a call on saturday xxxx xxxx because the refund be not process , I be tell that it take xxxx hrs however because it be a holiday weekend the proceed with be post to my account on the next business day which be tuesday xxxx xxxx . on the xxxx of xxxx my account be credit for { $ . } only . I make a call to chase bank about the other { $ . } which should have also be credit and be tell that the atm be show that the cash be dispense and this be the final look , if want to take it far I can file a police report . after feel so dejected and out of pocket as I have no money to finance my monthly expense . I go to visit the branch to see if there be anything that can be do for I , I be tell that just what I do be exactly the same procedure they must follow , as the branch do not service the atm , it be do by their back office personnel . on xxxx xxxx the amount of { $ . } previously credit to my account be reverse . I make a call on xxxx xxxx in regard to the reversal and be tell that my claim have be close however it will be reopen this time as per my request in order that their personnel can investigate , the investigation will take - day . I make a call xxxx xxxx to inquire as to the status of my claim and be tell my claim have be close there be nothing more that chase bank can do for I . please note that I have be a customer of this bank for   year and never encounter a problem such as this . now that I have I be treat with scant respect . I need chase bank to return my money I be request a full refund of { $ . } to my account . as a result of this error I be place in an uncomfortable position of borrow money from my friend in order to finance my monthly obligation .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"complaint_POS_removed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20794,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"credit card chase time debt account balance account chase report credit score chase report account run item carlifonia   xx foot carlifonia purchase card credit card year charge card use representative chase credit card number copy statement charge account chase card decline copy statement reason complaint chase report charge account chase credit amount report lift account\",\n          \"ticket credit card name system number name ticket document ticket provide ticket day system company refuse ticket force bus moment show provide document ticket credit card company chase difficulty charge occasion merchant case mail something nothing case case rep conclusion travel industry information use passenger credit card number information store network company ability ticket time charge product customer service representative option card customer service representative effort relationship connect dispute department time issue phone forth hour cfpb thank\",\n          \"product company product text agreement merchant merchant ignore month decide bank involve fund week day purchase day product deliver yesterday merchant manifold money bank anything proof company product send\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

demand reserve for specify cash balance in my xxxx account in reserve for a provision in my xxxx divorce decree that have previously be satisfied with my ex - wife ; demand further cash reserve beyond   mos balance which be hold in chase account by require account at other bank ;

i.e. , cash out or owelty rate & term refinance but not combine ;   ) chase order an appraisal which be available to use by another lender who actually understand how to process and owelty refinance and refuse to allow for the appraisal to be release and thereby cause duplicate expense and further delay ;   ) chase have claim that new requirement for conventional loan have be publish as a result of covid- and now require I to assert that I be self - employ - which I believe chase be do so that the rate chase lock for this loan and the type of product can be change to cover up their series of error and charge more for the loan . \\n\\n lastly , chase have collect all of the documentation request and have edit the entry on the application and demand that I sign these modify form . I notice several error and omission on their part in how they record the datum they demand and to which I provide document , yet they have not correct those same form . \\n\\n I believe chase be act in bad faith and be fabricate unreasonable demand to delay progress on the application because they know they can not proceed as a split cash - out / owelty rate & term loan as they have construct . the chase management have give excuse that they can not release the appraisal because they could be help liable ; state that the covid- rule require xxxx attestation and will not confirm that chase will refund the { $ . } I pay at application .\",\n          \"in xx / xx/ I open a xxxx auto loan with chase bank . today , I try to make my payment via the telephone and be unsure of whether it have go through or not .

tuesday xx/xx/. on thursday xx/xx/ i went into a branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day. that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday, xx/xx/. upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday, xx/xx/xxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. now, chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. unfortunately, this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document. i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i

chase bank on xxxx and used a code for xxxx bonus. i called to follow up on xx/xx/xxxx about the terms and was told everything was on the account and once i made xxxx direct deposit the bonus would be paid out in  days. as of xxxx i had made the required deposits and was told my account never had the coupon code applied and it was past the  days to do so, so no bonus would be paid.

{$.} to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card. i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank. i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than  of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account. i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. this all happened no later than  after putting in the application on xx/xx/. notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative, chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx/xx/. this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error.

during the summer months, i experience a decline income due to my employment. therefore, i request a one month payment extension with my auto loan company, chase. for the past almost fours years, my request for payment extension is granted. i have never been delinquent with my auto loan payment. however, on xx/xx/ my request for a one month payment extension was denied this year. i explained my situation to representative and the supervisor with no avail. after a lengthy discussion and waiting, i was informed the reason for the decline as it is not \" contractual ''. this reason for denial baffled me and therefore i emailed the office of xxxx xxxx executive director, communications, jpmorgan chase & co. a representative contacted me and stated chase will follow-up. about week later a representative of xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx office called. the representative shared her role was help resolve the matter. the representative via conference call contacted the department handing my request. after, reviewing my information my request was still denied based on \" policy changes ''. i requested an explanation and representative stated a letter will be mailed with explanation. i have received xxxx letters the reason for denial was not \" policy changes ''. i would like cfpb help in exploring the denial of my payment extension request especially since i have been clear reason for denial.

they showed that on the xxxx of xx/xx/ i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill. i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx. \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for {$.} later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment. \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything. \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount. they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late for not paying what accrued to be {$.} the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them. i still have {$.} in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app. \\n\\nadditionally, because they reported me being late my credit score dropped  points. when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own. i think that's

I recently call to ask chase bank why they report to the credit bureau that I be   day late on a payment that be already pay off . when I call I get this info : they show that on the xxxx of xx / xx/ I be very late on my bill and owe xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finish with the bill . I pay that amount on the same day the xxxx to be it to xxxx . \\n\\n they say that I try to make another payment for { $ . } later that same day and in a few day that come back as a return payment . \\n\\n the man on the phone state to I that if the payment go through then it would have mean that I have a credit on my account for xxxx since I do not owe anything . \\n\\n they update my account with charge and late fee from the return payment that I have no idea of since I think I pay off the entire amount . they report to the credit bureau that I be   day late for not pay what accrue to be { $ . } the guy represent chase agree with I that they be in the wrong for charge I the fee and say they would remove they . I still have { $ . } in the negative that they be say that I owe in the mobile app . \\n\\n additionally , because they report I be late my credit score drop   point . when I call back to ask if they can report that they make a mistake they say I would have to do that on my own .

i made payments of {$.} on xx/xx/xxxx and {$.} on xx/xx/xxxx. the minimum payment was {$.}. the closing date was xx/xx/xxxx ( please see attached statement ). that statement ( xx/xx/xxxx ) shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of {$.} on xx/xx/xxxx. i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xx/xx/xxxx. \\nhowever, when i got the xxxx statement, it shows that i still have a purchase balance of {$.}. i have a promotional balance (@xxxx ) in xxxx of {$.}. in xxxx, the promotional balance was {$.} - a difference of {$.}. \\n\\napparently, the payment ( above the minimum payment required by chase ) i thought would be applied to the purchase (@ . % ) was applied to the promotional balance first. it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met, payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first. this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit. i need help in rectifying this problem, because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase. thank you in advance for your assistance. \\n\\nrespectfully, xxxx xxxx xxxx

$ . } on xx / xx / xxxx . I make payment of { $ . } on xx / xx / xxxx and { $ . } on xx / xx / xxxx . the minimum payment be { $ . } . the closing date be xx / xx / xxxx ( please see attached statement ) . that statement ( xx / xx / xxxx ) show that I have an outstanding purchase balance of { $ . } on xx / xx / xxxx . I have enclose the previous month statement to show that there be no other purchase prior to the one on xx / xx / xxxx . \\n however , when I get the xxxx statement , it show that I still have a purchase balance of { $ . } . I have a promotional balance ( @xxxx ) in xxxx of { $ . } . in xxxx , the promotional balance be { $ . } - a difference of { $ . } . \\n\\n apparently , the payment ( above the minimum payment require by chase ) I think would be apply to the purchase ( @ . % ) be apply to the promotional balance first . it be my understanding that once the minimum payment have be meet , payment in excess of the minimum would be apply to the high interest rate balance first . this be not the first time that chase have skirt we financial law to turn a large profit . I need help in rectify this problem , because my logic fall on deaf ear at chase . thank you in advance for your assistance . \\n\\n respectfully , xxxx xxxx xxxx                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      purchase payment payment closing date statement statement purchase balance month statement purchase one xx statement purchase balance balance   balance difference payment payment require chase purchase % balance payment payment excess minimum interest rate balance time chase law profit help rectify problem fall ear chase thank advance assistance       2\n",

transaction. i placed a disputes case with chase bank on xx/xx/ when i noticed the charge on my account. i called back on sunday, xx/xx/ about the provisional credit for the charge and again on monday, xx/xx/. i was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided. i used my debt card on monday, xx/xx/ then tried to use it again but it would not work. i went to chase bank on xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx xxxx, nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity. i was shocked because i had not reported fraud on my account. i later found out that i was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from xxxx xxxx  xxxx. i later contacted xxxx xxxx  xxxx again and was told that they did see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within  -   days. i contacted the chase disputes department again on monday, xx/xx/xxxx.  and explained thaxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx would credit my account and that i did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim. the escalation manager did not care and told me that chase decision on closing my account was final. i had been a customer of chase for xxxx   years. my character has been challenged by the disputes agents and i consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander. \\n\\ni am not seeking to keep my account open with chase but i also do not want chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily. \\n\\nonce again, i do not want chase to have the checking account that i had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by chase. \\n\\ni did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past.

                  to whom it may concern, chase bank charged wrongly overdraft fees, i have alert of low balance or unsuficent fee balance and always deposit immediatly to cover transactions if needed but chase always changed the order and charged me overdraft fee anyway. when you call they said their per their guidelines they don't refund more then  overdrawft doesn't matter bank fault or not.\\n\\ntaken {$.} from people is money just because you can is not ok.\\n\\nsee attached documents. when chase refund, they always find the way to take back what they refunded in first place.

                                         my chase amazon card was declined for a catering order i had placed for my brothers funeral in the amount of {$.}. i contacted chase around noon today xx/xx/ and was asked the last  numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account. i responded that i did not have a savings and i am only authorized user. customer rep told me they would call me back in  minutes to keep the line open. i didnt receive a call back after an hour so i contacted chase. from the first call i thought someone was using my card fraudulently. i spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor xxxx who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. called the catering company and card was declined. i then used my xxxx  xxxx card to pay for the order. xxxx xxxx texted me asking if i was authorizing purchase and i responded yes. contacted caterer and xxxx  xxxx was declined. i contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. she told me the cvv code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and i responded that i had gone over the numbers and cvv used was correct. she told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for  hours. called caterer - card declined. use a mastercard  which processed. went to use chase amazon at restaurant at xxxx pm tonight in the amount of {$.} - it was declined. i was told by chase i was not over limit. still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use. embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting i was over my limit which i pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that i was under my limit with the {$.} transaction. never been declined by either chase or xxxx  xxxx before - today after multiple assurances that i was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear - it never

'' that xxxx, my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that \" the transfer has been completed. however, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team. '' i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer. i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for. \\n\\ni called xxxx who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction. i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase 's system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction. she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. i ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again. i was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for. after i told her that i had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. in both phone calls, they asked if i initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nduring this whole process, it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. these transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. i feel deceived by chase 's advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team.

I be once again transfer to the claim department , who tell I that I need to contact xxxx to get the information I be look for . after I tell she that I have already contact they , she finally admit that there be nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction be not secure . she say that chase have no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputte and that the recipient banking information be not keep in the system . in both phone call , they ask if I initiate that transaction , and use that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter . \\n\\n during this whole process , it feel like chase be not transparent about their policy regard these type of transaction nor be they helpful in help I get any information about the situation . these transaction be advertise as a \" fast , safe and easy way to send money , '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business . I feel deceive by chase 's advertising and far victimize by the way I be treat by the member on their customer service team .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  payment online retailer use pay  chase website website confirmation product response inquiry regard order contact chase information transaction refund retailer bank message way transaction contact  information recipient  message response restate email inform transfer website scam email expertise team order regard refund consumer online support team number list email situation transfer claim department transaction chase information transfer agent call closing script contact number opportunity information question  word phrase information system bank bank app transaction menu customer service agent information transaction chase system bank app transaction line everything well understanding situation call chase time agent try information bank information information situation claim department  information contact nothing nature transaction type transaction chase information recipient email address recipient banking information system phone call transaction responsibility regard matter process chase policy type transaction help information situation transaction fast way money way business chase advertising way member customer service team      3\n",

ads and other communications ). \\n\\nin it, they force me into binding arbitration ( despite that never being something i had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them ). \\n\\nthey do include a method to opt out, but have no additional information about the consequences ( many other people i've seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out ) and, even more egregiously, despite chase simply sending an email doing this, they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out. \\n\\nthis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out. \\n\\nthis is blatant malpractice by chase.

information regard change to your chase account '' ( they often use similar title for ad and other communication ) . \\n\\n in it , they force I into bind arbitration ( despite that never be something I have agree to and never be a part of any contract between I and they ) . \\n\\n they do include a method to opt out , but have no additional information about the consequence ( many other people I have see who have have a similar problem be afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out ) and , even more egregiously , despite chase simply send an email do this , they require I to mail they a letter with my personal information enclose in order to opt out . \\n\\n this be clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that be clearly be use solely to dissuade people from opt out . \\n\\n this be blatant malpractice by chase .

demand reserve for specify cash balance in my xxxx account in reserve for a provision in my xxxx divorce decree that have previously be satisfied with my ex - wife ; demand further cash reserve beyond   mos balance which be hold in chase account by require account at other bank ;

i.e. , cash out or owelty rate & term refinance but not combine ;   ) chase order an appraisal which be available to use by another lender who actually understand how to process and owelty refinance and refuse to allow for the appraisal to be release and thereby cause duplicate expense and further delay ;   ) chase have claim that new requirement for conventional loan have be publish as a result of covid- and now require I to assert that I be self - employ - which I believe chase be do so that the rate chase lock for this loan and the type of product can be change to cover up their series of error and charge more for the loan . \\n\\n lastly , chase have collect all of the documentation request and have edit the entry on the application and demand that I sign these modify form . I notice several error and omission on their part in how they record the datum they demand and to which I provide document , yet they have not correct those same form . \\n\\n I believe chase be act in bad faith and be fabricate unreasonable demand to delay progress on the application because they know they can not proceed as a split cash - out / owelty rate & term loan as they have construct . the chase management have give excuse that they can not release the appraisal because they could be help liable ; state that the covid- rule require xxxx attestation and will not confirm that chase will refund the { $ . } I pay at application .\",\n          \"in xx / xx/ I open a xxxx auto loan with chase bank . today , I try to make my payment via the telephone and be unsure of whether it have go through or not .

I again key in { $ . } and request large bill and again I receive xxxx ' s. i they proceed to key in { $ . } to which I receive a receipt which indicate that my transaction be deny . \\n I then check my account and realize I be debit twice for { $ . } , once for { $ . } and also credit for { $ . } . ( the { $ . } transaction be subsequently wash ) . I make a call to chase bank about the atm transaction and to report and file a claim , I be tell by the representative that I will be credit { $ . } in xxxx hrs . I make a call on saturday xxxx xxxx because the refund be not process , I be tell that it take xxxx hrs however because it be a holiday weekend the proceed with be post to my account on the next business day which be tuesday xxxx xxxx . on the xxxx of xxxx my account be credit for { $ . } only . I make a call to chase bank about the other { $ . } which should have also be credit and be tell that the atm be show that the cash be dispense and this be the final look , if want to take it far I can file a police report . after feel so dejected and out of pocket as I have no money to finance my monthly expense .

demand reserve for specify cash balance in my xxxx account in reserve for a provision in my xxxx divorce decree that have previously be satisfied with my ex - wife ; demand further cash reserve beyond   mos balance which be hold in chase account by require account at other bank ;

i.e. , cash out or owelty rate & term refinance but not combine ;   ) chase order an appraisal which be available to use by another lender who actually understand how to process and owelty refinance and refuse to allow for the appraisal to be release and thereby cause duplicate expense and further delay ;   ) chase have claim that new requirement for conventional loan have be publish as a result of covid- and now require I to assert that I be self - employ - which I believe chase be do so that the rate chase lock for this loan and the type of product can be change to cover up their series of error and charge more for the loan . \\n\\n lastly , chase have collect all of the documentation request and have edit the entry on the application and demand that I sign these modify form . I notice several error and omission on their part in how they record the datum they demand and to which I provide document , yet they have not correct those same form . \\n\\n I believe chase be act in bad faith and be fabricate unreasonable demand to delay progress on the application because they know they can not proceed as a split cash - out / owelty rate & term loan as they have construct . the chase management have give excuse that they can not release the appraisal because they could be help liable ; state that the covid- rule require xxxx attestation and will not confirm that chase will refund the { $ . } I pay at application .\",\n          \"in xx / xx/ I open a xxxx auto loan with chase bank . today , I try to make my payment via the telephone and be unsure of whether it have go through or not .

I go to visit the branch to see if there be anything that can be do for I , I be tell that just what I do be exactly the same procedure they must follow , as the branch do not service the atm , it be do by their back office personnel . on xxxx xxxx the amount of { $ . } previously credit to my account be reverse .
